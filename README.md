# CSS HTML Form Designs
Shamelessly copied from [Sanwebe (Saran Chamling)](https://www.sanwebe.com/2014/08/css-html-forms-designs) awesome blog. 

## Changes
Made a few changes to improve new features premariy 
* removed the now no obsolete (thank gawd) browser prefixes.
* change URLs to secure agnostic ones


## TODO
Should I consolidate the css in one file? Dunno. I like it this way. 
* `boxsizing: border-box;` everywhere, would be nice and modern
* make an even more awesomazing Sass version.
